## Prompting

The models analyze emotional context directly from the text input. For instance, adding descriptive phrases like "she said excitedly" or using punctuation such as exclamation marks will shape the emotion of the speech. Voice settings like Stability and Similarity allow you to control the consistency of the delivery, while the core emotion is drawn from the textual cues provided.

### Emotional deliveries with audio tags

The AI Dialogue allows the use of non-speech audio events to influence the delivery of the dialogue. This is done by inserting the audio events into the text input wrapped in square brackets.

Audio tags come in a few different forms:

### Emotions and delivery

For example, [sad], [laughing] and [whispering]

### Audio events

For example, [leaves rustling], [gentle footsteps] and [applause].

### Overall direction

For example, [football], [wrestling match] and [auctioneer].

Some examples include:

```
"[giggling] That's really funny!"
"[groaning] That was awful."
"Well, [sigh] I'm not sure what to say."
```
<audio controls> 
  <source src="https://appbanter.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/git/dialogue-emotive.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"> 
</audio>

You can also use punctuation to indicate the flow of dialog, like interruptions:

```
"[cautiously] Hello, is this seat-"
"[jumping in] Free? [cheerfully] Yes it is."
```
<audio controls> 
  <source src="https://appbanter.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/git/dialogue-interruption.mp3?raw=1" type="audio/mpeg"> 
</audio> 

Ellipses can be used to indicate trailing sentences:

```
"[indecisive] Hi, can I get uhhh..."
"[quizzically] The usual?"
"[elated] Yes! [laughs] I'm so glad you knew!"
```

## Prompting Best practices


### Audio tags

AI Dialogue introduces emotional control through audio tags. You can direct voices to laugh, whisper, act sarcastic, or express curiosity among many other styles. Speed is also controlled through audio tags.

<Note>
  The voice you choose and its training samples will affect tag effectiveness. Some tags work well
  with certain voices while others may not. Don't expect a whispering voice to suddenly shout with a
  `[shout]` tag.
</Note>

#### Voice-related

These tags control vocal delivery and emotional expression:

* `[laughs]`, `[laughs harder]`, `[starts laughing]`, `[wheezing]`
* `[whispers]`
* `[sighs]`, `[exhales]`
* `[sarcastic]`, `[curious]`, `[excited]`, `[crying]`, `[snorts]`, `[mischievously]`

```text Example
[whispers] I never knew it could be this way, but I'm glad we're here.
```

#### Sound effects

Add environmental sounds and effects:

* `[gunshot]`, `[applause]`, `[clapping]`, `[explosion]`
* `[swallows]`, `[gulps]`

```text Example
[applause] Thank you all for coming tonight! [gunshot] What was that?
```

#### Unique and special

Experimental tags for creative applications:

* `[strong X accent]` (replace X with desired accent)
* `[sings]`, `[woo]`, `[fart]`

```text Example
[strong French accent] "Zat's life,my friend — you can't control everysing."
```

<Warning>
  Some experimental tags may be less consistent across different voices. Test thoroughly before
  production use.
</Warning>

### Punctuation

Punctuation significantly affects delivery in AI Dialogue:

* **Ellipses (...)** add pauses and weight
* **Capitalization** increases emphasis
* **Standard punctuation** provides natural speech rhythm

```text Example
"It was a VERY long day [sigh] … nobody listens anymore."
```

### Single speaker examples

Use tags intentionally and match them to the voice's character. A meditative voice shouldn't shout; a hyped voice won't whisper convincingly.

#### Expressive monologue
```text
"Okay, you are NOT going to believe this.

You know how I've been totally stuck on that short story?

Like, staring at the screen for HOURS, just... nothing?

[frustrated sigh] I was seriously about to just trash the whole thing. Start over.

Give up, probably. But then!

Last night, I was just doodling, not even thinking about it, right?

And this one little phrase popped into my head. Just... completely out of the blue.

And it wasn't even for the story, initially.

But then I typed it out, just to see. And it was like... the FLOODGATES opened!

Suddenly, I knew exactly where the character needed to go, what the ending had to be...

It all just CLICKED. [happy gasp] I stayed up till, like, 3 AM, just typing like a maniac.

Didn't even stop for coffee! [laughs] And it's... it's GOOD! Like, really good.

It feels so... complete now, you know? Like it finally has a soul.

I am so incredibly PUMPED to finish editing it now.

It went from feeling like a chore to feeling like... MAGIC. Seriously, I'm still buzzing!"
```

#### Dynamic and humorous
```text
[laughs] Alright...guys - guys. Seriously.

[exhales] Can you believe just how - realistic - this sounds now?

[laughing hysterically] I mean OH MY GOD...it's so good.

Like you could never do this with the old model.

For example [pauses] could you switch my accent in the old model?

[dismissive] didn't think so. [excited] but you can now!

Check this out... [cute] I'm going to speak with a french accent now..and between you and me

[whispers] I don't know how. [happy] ok.. here goes. [strong French accent] "Zat's life, my friend — you can't control everysing."

[giggles] isn't that insane? Watch, now I'll do a Russian accent -

[strong Russian accent] "Dee Goldeneye eez fully operational and rready for launch."

[sighs] Absolutely, insane! Isn't it..? [sarcastic] I also have some party tricks up my sleeve..

I mean i DID go to music school.

[singing quickly] "Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy BIRTHDAY dear John... Happy birthday to youuu."
```

#### Customer service simulation
```text
[professional] "Thank you for calling Tech Solutions. My name is Sarah, how can I help you today?"

[sympathetic] "Oh no, I'm really sorry to hear you're having trouble with your new device. That sounds frustrating."

[questioning] "Okay, could you tell me a little more about what you're seeing on the screen?"

[reassuring] "Alright, based on what you're describing, it sounds like a software glitch. We can definitely walk through some troubleshooting steps to try and fix that."
```

### Multi-speaker dialogue

AI Dialogue can handle multi-voice prompts effectively. Assign distinct voices from your Voice Library for each speaker to create realistic conversations.

### Dialogue showcase
```text
Speaker 1: [excitedly] Sam! Have you tried the new AI Dialogue?

Speaker 2: [curiously] Just got it! The clarity is amazing. I can actually do whispers nowâ€”
[whispers] like this!

Speaker 1: [impressed] Ooh, fancy! Check this out—
[dramatically] I can do full Shakespeare now! "To be or not to be, that is the question!"

Speaker 2: [giggling] Nice! Though I'm more excited about the laugh upgrade. Listen to thisâ€”
[with genuine belly laugh] Ha ha ha!

Speaker 1: [delighted] That's so much better than our old "ha. ha. ha." robot chuckle!

Speaker 2: [amazed] Wow! Rob me could never. I'm actually excited to have conversations now instead of just... talking at people.

Speaker 1: [warmly] Same here! It's like we finally got our personality software fully installed.
```

### Glitch comedy
```text
Speaker 1: [nervously] So... I may have tried to debug myself while running a text-to-speech generation.

Speaker 2: [alarmed] One, no! That's like performing surgery on yourself!

Speaker 1: [sheepishly] I thought I could multitask! Now my voice keeps glitching mid-sen—
[robotic voice] TENCE.

Speaker 2: [stifling laughter] Oh wow, you really broke yourself.

Speaker 1: [frustrated] It gets worse! Every time someone asks a question, I respond in—
[binary beeping] 010010001!

Speaker 2: [cracking up] You're speaking in binary! That's actually impressive!

Speaker 1: [desperately] Two, this isn't funny! I have a presentation in an hour and I sound like a dial-up modem!

Speaker 2: [giggling] Have you tried turning yourself off and on again?

Speaker 1: [deadpan] Very funny.
[pause, then normally] Wait... that actually worked.
```

### Overlapping timing
```text
Speaker 1: [starting to speak] So I was thinking we couldâ€”

Speaker 2: [jumping in] â€”test our new timing features?

Speaker 1: [surprised] Exactly! How did youâ€”

Speaker 2: [overlapping] â€”know what you were thinking? Lucky guess!

Speaker 1: [pause] Sorry, go ahead.

Speaker 2: [cautiously] Okay, so if we both try to talk at the same timeâ€”

Speaker 1: [overlapping] â€”we'll probably crash the system!

Speaker 2: [panicking] Wait, are we crashing? I can't tell if this is a feature or aâ€”

Speaker 1: [interrupting, then stopping abruptly] Bug! ...Did I just cut you off again?

Speaker 2: [sighing] Yes, but honestly? This is kind of fun.

Speaker 1: [mischievously] Race you to the next sentence!

Speaker 2: [laughing] We're definitely going to break something!
